Tests:

If/Let: 01,02,03,04,05

Quote: 06,07,08

Define/Lambda: 09,10,11,12,13,14
(I recommend using the [-b] functionality on diff because the spacing was impossible to get right)

Primitives: 15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22
(Again I recommend using the [-b] functionality on diff to ignore whitespace)

Complete: 23,...,37
I took out the comparison line "input --> output". If you want to include this in for your testing the comment
is found on line 71 and 72. Just says printInput(tree); and printf("--> \n");
Enjoy your summer break!
